\title{Inner product between two predictor_hybrid objects (with broadcasting)}
\usage{
inprod.predictor_hybrid(xi_1, xi_2 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{xi_1}{A \code{predictor_hybrid} object.}

\item{xi_2}{Another \code{predictor_hybrid} object. If missing, defaults to \code{xi_1}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of inner products, or a scalar if both inputs contain a single observation.
}
\description{
Computes the inner product between two \code{predictor_hybrid} objects,
including both functional and scalar components. Supports broadcasting
when one of the inputs has a single observation.
