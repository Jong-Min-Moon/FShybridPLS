Description: Implements a Penalized Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression
    framework designed for hybrid predictors that combine both functional
    (infinite-dimensional) and scalar (finite-dimensional) covariates. The
    algorithm maximizes the covariance between the hybrid predictors and a
    scalar response variable while incorporating a roughness penalty to
    ensure the smoothness of the estimated functional coefficient curves.
    The package includes tools for data simulation using matrix-normal
    distributions, two-step data normalization, and cross-validated model
    fitting.
